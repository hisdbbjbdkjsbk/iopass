            <p class="slide-about__text">
              Lack of communication is an important element now in the use of
              technology, since the industrial revolution, the human being
              interacted with the machine effortlessly until the technology
              developed so that the human being would have less contact with it.
              The radio appeared, the camera, the television, the computer, the
              Internet, the mobile phone, the smart phone, which developed into
              a merger of all of these elements into one. Rather, it did not
              stop from that. It included the payment system, and the phone
              became not just a tool for entertainment only, but rather an
              electronic wallet, and it did not stop either. The phone carries
              the person’s identity in some countries that have contributed to
              the development of information technology so that the person’s
              identity becomes available on his phone without the need to carry
              his identity. We are here with this vision, we want to develop the
              technological system to be more interactive and less friction, and
              perhaps it can be said that it is touchless, and this is what
              technology is seeking. Specialized in information technology
              development from the parent company Creative Clout. We make it in
              our subsidiary company something tangible that benefits society
              and makes life easie<b>r</b>
